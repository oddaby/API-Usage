# API Testing for Beginners with Python 🚀

## Introduction

Welcome to the API Testing for Beginners project with Python! This guide is designed to help you get started with API testing from scratch using Python. Whether you are new to testing or just looking to explore API testing, this repository has everything you need.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:


### Python 🐍

1. Download and install Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### pip 📦

Pip is usually included with Python installations. To ensure it's up-to-date, run:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### pytest 🧪

Install pytest using pip:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

### Requests 🌐

Install the Requests library using pip:

```bash
pip install requests
```


```bash
cd api-testing-for-beginners or where you placed your project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

These commands assume that Python is added to your system's PATH. If not, you might need to provide the full path to the Python executable (e.g., `C:\Python39\python.exe`) when running the commands.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository ⬇️

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/api-testing-for-beginners.git
```

### Install Dependencies 📦

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd api-testing-for-beginners
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Understanding API Testing 🤔

### What is an API? ℹ️

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows one software application to interact with another. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

### Why API Testing? 🌐

API testing is crucial for ensuring the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of your software applications. It allows you to validate the communication between different software systems.

## Setting Up Your First Test 🏗️

### Choose a Testing Framework 🛠️

For this project, we'll use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/). Install it using:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

### Write Your First Test ✍️

Create a new test file, e.g., `test_api.py`, and write your first test using pytest:

```python
# test_api.py

import requests

def test_example():
    response = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert "userId" in response.json()
```

## Running Tests ▶️

To run your tests, use the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

## Best Practices 🚦

- Keep your tests independent and isolated.
- Use meaningful test and function names.
- Handle authentication and authorization properly.
- Check for expected status codes and response data.

## Resources 📚

- [Python Requests Documentation](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
- [pytest Documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/)
